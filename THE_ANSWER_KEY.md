    This IS the integration hub they hinted at."

4. REBALANCING RECOMMENDATIONS (10%)
   Use THEIR language: "rebalance", "unlock"
   
   Template:
   "Rebalancing strategy:
    1. Reduce public wage premium by [X]%
    2. Improve private sector protections
    3. Create incentives for private employment
    
    Expected effects:
    • Release [Y]% of queue to private
    • Increase private productivity +[Z]%
    • Spillover: Improves gender equality (Cat 2)"
