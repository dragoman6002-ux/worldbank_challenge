this is for information purposes. 
the goal is to help the team not showoff
it will take forever if I explain how it works
this is not that. 
we have an objective. to win the game
let's win the game
it will allow us to make a presentation
that is memorable. actionable, and achieves an objective
let's win. (dont ask me for any of the code. unless you have beer money 
and time to drink and smoke cigarettes after this)
(than maybe)
